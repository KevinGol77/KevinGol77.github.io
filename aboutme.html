    <h2> About this page<h2>
      <p>This page is all about me and my story.<br> A Sophomore pursuing a degree in Business Administration and minor in computer Science. <br>
        I hope to take alot away from this class and possibly one day use my skills <br> to build a website on my own whether it be for me or a client.
